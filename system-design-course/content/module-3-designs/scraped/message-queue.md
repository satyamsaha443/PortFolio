# Design a Pub-Sub / Message Queue

## Problem statement

Design a durable, high-throughput message system that decouples producers from consumers: producers append events; many independent consumer groups read them at their own pace, replay history, and survive each other's failures.

This is the Kafka lineage — a partitioned, append-only log, not a transient queue. In scope: publishing to a topic, consuming as part of a group while committing progress, replaying from any offset, and retaining messages for a window or compacting the log (keeping only the latest record per key, dropping older ones).

## Clarifying questions

Each answer changes the design, so state it and the assumption it fixes.

Delivery guarantee? At-least-once (duplicates OK, the common default), at-most-once (loss OK, never duplicate), or exactly-once (hard, expensive)? The central design axis.

Ordering requirement? Global order (forces a single partition — no parallelism), per-key order (the usual answer — partition by key), or none?

Throughput and message size? Millions of small events/sec versus thousands of large payloads change partition count and storage.

Retention? Replay-the-last-N-days (log retention), consume-and-delete (queue semantics), or compacted (latest per key)?

How many consumer groups, and are they independent? Fan-out to many independent readers off one stream is the pub-sub strength.

Latency versus throughput? Batching trades latency for throughput; real-time alerting and bulk ETL want different tuning.

## What makes this problem distinctive

A transient queue deletes a message once it's consumed, which is fine for one worker draining tasks — but it cannot replay history, cannot fan out to several independent readers, and loses everything a slow consumer hasn't read yet. The distinctive move here is to keep the data as an append-only log and move the cursor from the server to the client.

Once the data is a durable log and each reader tracks its own position into it, four properties follow that a delete-on-consume queue cannot offer: replay (a reader can move its cursor back), independent fan-out (several readers each keep their own cursor), backpressure (a slow reader lags behind instead of overwhelming the server), and crash recovery (a restarted reader resumes from its last saved position). Everything later in the design — how the log is split for parallelism, how it is replicated for durability, and when a reader saves its position — builds on that one move.

Key idea. A pub-sub system is an append-only log with the cursor moved from the server to the client; that one move buys replay, fan-out, backpressure, and crash recovery.

## Key concepts

This section covers the concepts needed to solve this problem — prerequisites for the design work that follows.

### The partitioned append-only log

A topic is a named stream split into N partitions, each an ordered, append-only log of messages. Ordering is guaranteed within a partition, not across them — which lets the design provide both order (per partition) and parallelism (many partitions).

### Offsets and consumer groups

Each message has an offset — a monotonic position within a partition. A consumer group divides the partitions among its members (one partition per consumer), and each group tracks its own offset per partition, so the broker stores no per-reader state and many groups read independently.

### Producers and pull-based consumers

A producer picks a partition — by key hash for ordering, or round-robin for spread. A consumer pulls batches and tracks its own offset, so it reads at its own rate, replays from any offset, and a slow consumer lags rather than overwhelming the broker — natural backpressure.

### Delivery semantics

The guarantee depends on when you commit the offset relative to processing. Commit before processing risks loss (at-most-once); commit after risks reprocessing on a crash (at-least-once — the practical default); exactly-once needs the output and the offset commit to be atomic.

### Replication, ISR, and acks

Each partition has a leader (handles reads/writes) and follower replicas; caught-up followers form the in-sync replica set (ISR). With acks=all, a write commits only once the ISR has it — the durability-versus-latency dial.

Key idea. Partitions give parallelism and per-key order; the per-reader offset gives replay and fan-out; replication plus ISR plus acks give durability; when you commit the offset gives the delivery semantic.

## 1. Requirements

Before reading on. List the requirements, then name the property you would never compromise and the constraint that drives the design.

### 1.1 Functional requirements

Publish a message to a topic.

Subscribe/consume from a topic as part of a consumer group; commit progress (offset).

Replay from an arbitrary offset (re-process history).

Retain messages for a configured window (time/size), or compact to the latest value per key.

### 1.2 Non-functional requirements

Throughput — order of millions of messages/sec; scale linearly by adding partitions and brokers.

Durability — a committed message survives f broker failures (set by replication and acks).

Ordering — guaranteed within a partition.

Availability — producers and consumers keep working through broker failure (leader failover).

Delivery guarantee — at-least-once by default, with a path to exactly-once for callers that need it.

### 1.3 The constraint versus the property

Durability of a committed message is the property to protect: once acked under acks=all, the message survives broker loss — which is why the ISR and replication exist. Throughput is the constraint that drives the design: millions of messages per second forces the partitioned log, sequential disk appends, and pull-based consumers, and makes partition count the unit of both parallelism and placement.

Key idea. Protect committed-message durability via replication; design around throughput, which forces partitioning and the append-only log.

## 2. Back-of-the-envelope estimation

The numbers size the partition count (from throughput) and storage (from retention × replication) — and partition count is also the ceiling on consumer parallelism. Illustrative anchors.

### 2.1 Throughput and partitions

At 1M messages/sec × 1 KB = 1 GB/sec. At a conservative ~50 MB/sec per partition, that is ≥ ~20 partitions for raw throughput — but more (100+) are typically provisioned for consumer parallelism and headroom, because a consumer group can have at most one consumer per partition.

### 2.2 Storage and retention

1 GB/sec × 7-day retention = ~600 TB, and × replication factor 3 = ~1.8 PB. Retention is the storage dial: keep more history, pay more disk. Tiered storage (old segments to object storage) decouples retention from broker disk.

Key idea. Throughput sets a partition floor, but consumer parallelism sets the real partition count; retention × replication sets storage.

## 3. API design

Five operations: publish, pull, commit, replay, and topic creation.

Topic creation is a design decision, not an afterthought: the partition count caps consumer parallelism (one partition is read by one consumer in a group) and the replication factor sets how many broker failures a committed message survives — both flow straight from the estimation numbers.

Key idea. The key controls partitioning and order; poll is pull (a slow consumer lags, not overwhelms); when you commit sets the delivery guarantee; seek replays; createTopic fixes the parallelism and durability dials up front.

## 4. Data model

The data model begins with a message on a topic; each thing it can't represent adds the next piece.

### 4.1 The log, the offset, the cursor, the segment

A single stream can't give both ordering and parallelism, so a topic is N partitions, each an ordered append-only log. "Ordered" needs a name for a position, so each message has an offset (monotonic, per-partition). The broker can't track who has read what for every reader, so the cursor moves to the consumer — a group offset per partition. And retention can't depend on consumption, so a partition persists as segment files on disk, aged out by time/size or compacted, independent of who has read it.

Each partition's segments live on a broker's disk, and a topic's partitions spread across brokers — so partition count is both the parallelism ceiling and the unit of placement. Offsets live separately from the data, since they belong to readers. The log is immutable and shared; only the cursors move.

Key idea. Immutable partitioned log on disk as segments; per-reader cursors; the log never moves, only the offsets do.

## 5. High-level design

The design is derived incrementally, each problem pulling in the next piece.

Reading the diagrams. Each step marks the components newly added at that step with a dashed outline and a NEW badge.

### 5.1 Durability via an append-only log

Messages must survive a broker restart, so write each to an append-only log file on disk. Immutability is what later enables replay and multiple readers.

### 5.2 Fix 1: partitions for parallelism

One log on one broker can't absorb millions/sec, and one consumer can't drain them. Split the topic into N partitions, each its own append-only log across brokers; producers hash keys for ordering or round-robin for spread.

### 5.3 Fix 2: consumer independence via offsets

A crashed consumer must resume without losing its place or re-reading everything. Move the cursor from broker to reader: each consumer group keeps its own offset per partition, so crash recovery, replay, and independent fan-out come together.

### 5.4 Fix 3: fault tolerance via replication

A single-broker partition is vulnerable. Each partition gets a leader (all reads/writes) plus follower replicas on other brokers; caught-up followers form the ISR, and acks=all commits only after the ISR has the write. A coordinator tracks leadership, replica health, and group membership.

Key idea. Each piece answers one need: an append-only log for durability, partitions for parallelism, per-reader offsets for independence and replay, leader/ISR replication for fault tolerance.

## 6. Deep dives

### 6.1 Partitioning and ordering

Before reading on. A customer needs every event for a given user processed in order, but you also need 100-way parallelism. Can you have both — and what's the lever?

Yes, by per-key order: hash the key to a partition, so all of one user's events land in one partition (ordered) while 100 partitions give 100-way parallelism. What you cannot have is global total order plus parallelism — global order means one partition. Two caveats: partition count is hard to change later (raising it rehashes keys and breaks per-key order for in-flight keys, so over-provision up front), and a hot partition from a skewed key (one very high-volume key) is throttled to one partition's throughput — spread it with a compound key or accept the bound.

### 6.2 Delivery semantics

Before reading on. What does the offset commit have to be atomic with for exactly-once — and why is that hard across systems?

Three contracts, set by when you commit. At-most-once commits the offset before processing — a crash loses the message; rare, only when loss beats duplication. At-least-once commits after processing — a crash before commit reprocesses, so make consumers idempotent (dedupe by event id). Exactly-once needs the output and the offset commit to be one atomic step; the broker provides it within itself via an idempotent producer (a producer id + per-partition sequence lets the broker drop retries) plus transactions (atomically write outputs and commit offsets), but an external sink still needs its ow

Consider the within-broker case. A stream processor reads the message at offset 10, computes a result, writes it to the output topic, and commits its new position (offset 11) — and the output write and the offset commit go into one broker transaction that either both land or neither does. Two failure modes show why that matters. If the processor crashes after writing the output but before committing, the transaction never finalizes: its output is marked aborted (downstream readers configured for committed-reads skip it), and on restart the processor re-reads offset 10 and redoes the work — no 

### 6.3 Replication, durability, and rebalancing

Before reading on. A broker holding a partition leader dies, and consumers come and go constantly. What keeps committed data safe, and what is the operational failure mode that matters most?

In the write path with replication factor 3, the leader is L and the followers are F1, F2. The producer sends a record to L, which appends it at offset 42 to its own log. F1 and F2 continually fetch from L and append the same record. Once every replica in the ISR has offset 42, L marks it committed and acks the producer; with acks=all the producer only sees success after that point, so a committed record exists on all in-sync replicas. Now suppose F2 falls behind (a slow disk): the leader drops it from the ISR and keeps committing with just L and F1, trading one replica of safety for progress.

The failure mode that matters most in production is consumer-group rebalancing. For example, a topic has 3 partitions P0, P1, P2 and a group of 2 consumers: C1 owns P0, P1 and C2 owns P2. A third consumer C3 joins. The group coordinator triggers a rebalance: every consumer briefly stops processing, the partitions are reassigned to one each (C1→P0, C2→P1, C3→P2), and each consumer resumes its new partition from the last committed offset. The pause is the cost. If consumers flap, or a consumer takes longer than the poll timeout to process a batch, the coordinator assumes it died and rebalances a

## 7. Variants

These are follow-up extensions once the baseline log design is accepted, not new baseline requirements.

For 10× scale (tens of millions/sec), add partitions and brokers; the limits become coordinator metadata load and cross-broker replication bandwidth, and tiered storage (old segments to object storage) decouples retention from broker disk.

For exactly-once across systems, the usual answer is at-least-once + idempotency: give every event a stable id and make each sink dedupe on it; reserve broker transactions for the within-broker read-process-write loop.

For queue semantics, a work queue (consume-and-delete, competing consumers, no replay) is a mode of this design — a single consumer group with short retention. The log model can emulate queue semantics while still keeping replay and fan-out.

Log compaction is a different retention mode. Time/size retention drops old records; compaction instead keeps the latest record per key and discards superseded ones, turning the log into a durable changelog. For example, a log containing (k1=A), (k2=B), (k1=C), (k2=tombstone). After compaction, k1=A is gone (superseded by k1=C), and k2 is dropped entirely because its latest record is a tombstone (a delete marker). What remains is the current value of every live key — useful for event sourcing or change-data-capture, where a consumer that reads the compacted log from the start rebuilds the pres

Key idea. The same log scales by partitions and tiered storage; queue semantics and compaction are modes of it, and end-to-end exactly-once is at-least-once plus idempotency.

## 8. The transferable pattern

A pub-sub system is an append-only log with the cursor moved from the server to the client. That one move — consumers track their own offset into an immutable, partitioned, replicated log — provides replay, independent fan-out, natural backpressure, and crash recovery all at once. Partitioning gives parallelism and per-key order; replication and the ISR give durability; when you commit the offset gives the delivery semantic. The same shape recurs wherever producers decouple from consumers over time: event sourcing, change-data-capture, stream processing, write-ahead logs, even a database's own

## Review: the 30-second answer

A topic is a partitioned, append-only log. Each partition is ordered by offset; ordering holds within a partition, not across.

Producers pick a partition (key hash for order, round-robin for spread); consumer groups divide partitions, so parallelism = partition count.

Consumers pull and track their own offset — read at their own rate, replay from anywhere, don't interfere with other groups; the broker doesn't push, which is natural backpressure.

Delivery is a choice: at-most-once, at-least-once (default — expect duplicates), or exactly-once (idempotent producer + transactions, or idempotent consumers).

Durability via replication: leader + in-sync replicas; acks=all commits only once the ISR has the write.
