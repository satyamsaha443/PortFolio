# Design a Distributed Rate Limiter

> **Lesson 8.5** · Beginner · 60 min

## Problem statement

Design a service that decides, for each incoming API request, whether to allow it or reject it because the caller has exceeded a configured rate. The limiter sits in front of an API gateway or an internal RPC fabric, must answer in single-digit milliseconds, and must keep working when individual nodes — or an entire datacenter — fail.

The naive single-process counter falls over once two app servers sit behind a load balancer. The rest of the design is about what to do next. Adjacent problems — quotas, billing, and DDoS defense — are separate systems and out of scope here.

## Clarifying questions

Several parameters shape the architecture. Each question below settles one, paired with the assumption its answer fixes.

What is the limit keyed on? User id, API key, IP, tenant, endpoint, or a tuple. The key's cardinality drives storage size and shard layout.

What is the limit, and over what window? "100 per second" and "100 per minute" need different algorithms even at the same average — bursts behave differently.

How accurate must it be? A hard cap (overage costs money), a soft cap (protect a backend), or a coarse throttle (keep noisy neighbors from drowning the cluster).

What QPS hits the limiter itself? Fronting a high-traffic public API is a different system than fronting a low-traffic internal service.

Single-region or multi-region? A global limit across regions is strictly harder and may require accepting overage by design.

Fail-open or fail-closed? When the limiter is down, let traffic through or reject it? A product decision, not a technical one.

What does the client see on rejection? An HTTP 429, a Retry-After, the current quota? Surfacing state lets clients self-regulate; hiding it forces blind retries.

Each answer changes the architecture, so each is settled before designing.

## What makes a rate limiter hard

A rate limiter looks like a counter: increment on each request, deny past the limit. On one server that is a few lines of code. The problem is that real traffic arrives at many servers behind a load balancer, and they all have to agree.

The thing that shapes the architecture is that the limit is one shared counter every app server must agree on, at single-digit-millisecond latency. So the driving tension is accuracy versus the coordination-and-latency cost of agreeing. Push for exact accuracy and every decision waits on a shared store; push for speed and each server counts locally and the limit drifts.

Atomic read-modify-write. Reading a counter, deciding, and writing the new value as one indivisible step. If two servers read 99 at the same time, both think they are under a limit of 100, and both allow — the limit silently doubles.

Key idea. A limiter is a counter primitive plus a coordination strategy; the hard part is agreeing on the count atomically at sub-millisecond latency.

## Key concepts

This section covers the concepts needed to solve this problem — prerequisites for the design work that follows.

A limiter is assembled from two choices: how a window is counted, and where the count lives.

### Counting a window

Five algorithms recur, trading accuracy for memory. Fixed window buckets time into fixed intervals and counts the current bucket — cheap, but it lets a burst straddle the boundary. Sliding window counter keeps the current and previous bucket counts and blends them by how far into the window the request falls — O(1) memory, slightly approximate. Sliding window log stores a timestamp per request and counts what is newer than now - window — exact, but storage grows with the limit. Token bucket refills tokens at a fixed rate up to a capacity; each request spends one — allows bursts up to capacity,

The interactive widget below runs each algorithm over a request stream. Setting a limit and arrival rate shows which requests are allowed or denied as the window slides or the bucket refills and drains. Switching algorithms shows the fixed window admitting a boundary burst that the sliding counter rejects, and the token bucket admitting a burst that the leaky bucket smooths into a steady rate.

### The shared counter

On one server the counter is a local variable. Across a fleet it must move to a shared store that every limiter instance reads and writes, because per-server counters each see a fraction of traffic and let multiples of the limit through. That shared store is the heart of the design — and its single biggest cost, since every decision pays one network round-trip to reach it.

The failure is structural: each server enforces the full limit against only its slice of traffic, so the real cap becomes servers × limit.

### Central versus hybrid coordination

The shared counter can be central — one authoritative store, exact, but a round-trip per decision — or hybrid — each instance keeps a local approximate counter and syncs with the center on a short interval. Hybrid makes decisions in microseconds but over-allows by a bounded amount during each sync gap. The choice follows from the cost of being wrong — quantified, with the over-allowance math, in §6.2.

### Fail-open versus fail-closed

When the limiter's store is unreachable, the limiter must still answer. Fail-open allows traffic — the API stays up but unprotected. Fail-closed denies — the backend is protected but the limiter outage becomes an API outage. The right default depends on whether the backend can survive uncapped traffic.

Key idea. Choose an algorithm for how you count and a coordination strategy for where the count lives; the two axes tune independently.

## 1. Requirements

Before reading on. List the functional and non-functional requirements, then name the one property you would never compromise and the one constraint that drives the design. They are different here.

### 1.1 Functional requirements

The limiter answers one question per request and is configured out of band.

Decide allow or deny synchronously for each (key, action) pair.

Configure limits per key, varying by API tier, endpoint, and tenant.

Enforce multiple windows per key. A key often has a per-second and a per-day limit; deny on the tighter binding constraint.

Surface state. On allow, return remaining quota and reset time; on deny, return enough for the gateway to send a 429 with Retry-After.

### 1.2 Non-functional requirements

The qualities matter more than the feature list — a limiter that is slow or fragile is worse than none.

Sub-millisecond p99 added latency in the same datacenter; the limiter cannot become the bottleneck.

High availability — at least four nines, degrading gracefully when nodes or datacenters fail.

Horizontal scalability across instances with a sharding strategy.

Bounded inaccuracy — steady-state limits roughly correct; small boundary error under bursts is tolerable for soft limits.

### 1.3 The constraint versus the property

Availability is the property to protect: the limiter fronts every request, so it must keep answering even when its store is degraded — which is why fail-open versus fail-closed is its own decision. Latency is the constraint that drives the design: a sub-millisecond budget for the limiter's own added work (the single-digit-millisecond target in the problem statement is the end-to-end budget, including the backend) forces the atomic-operation choice and the central-versus-hybrid split. Accuracy is what is traded against that budget.

Key idea. Availability is the property to protect; the per-decision latency budget is the constraint to design around; accuracy is what is traded against it.

## 2. Back-of-the-envelope estimation

The numbers exist to size two things: how many shards the counter store needs, and how much a hybrid design over-allows. The figures are illustrative anchors, not measured values.

### 2.1 Throughput and shards

A single in-memory counter node handles on the order of 100K simple atomic operations per second — fewer for heavier scripts. A limiter fronting a public API doing 1,000,000 decisions per second, each checking a per-second and a per-day window, issues about 2,000,000 counter operations per second. That is 2,000,000 ÷ 100,000 ≈ 20+ shards, and 10× the traffic pushes past 100 shards. At this load the counter store has to shard by key.

### 2.2 Memory

State per key is tiny for most algorithms. Ten million active keys with a sliding window counter at two integers each is 10M × 24 bytes ≈ 240 MB — a single node holds it many times over. The sliding window log is the outlier: at 100 requests per minute it stores up to 100 timestamps per key, 10M × ~5 KB ≈ 50 GB (up to ~100 GB with overhead), which is the dominant storage cost on that path, especially once replicated.

### 2.3 Over-allowance under hybrid

In the hybrid pattern, each instance decides against its own local counter and reconciles with the central store only every sync interval. Between syncs, no instance sees the others' traffic, so each can independently believe it is under the limit — and the resulting error is computable. With 10 instances syncing every 100ms, each seeing 1,000 requests per second for a key limited to 500 per second, the worst case is every instance believing it is under the limit at once: 10 instances × 1,000 req/s × 0.1s = 1,000 extra requests in the gap before the next sync corrects them — a 200% overshoot f

Key idea. The two numbers that shape the design are the shard count (decision rate ÷ per-shard ceiling) and the hybrid over-allowance (fleet × rate × sync interval).

## 3. API design

The interface is small: one hot-path call to check a limit, one control-plane call to configure one. The check carries a cost so a heavy endpoint can spend more than one token per request.

### 3.1 Check a limit

The gateway calls this on every request. It returns the verdict plus the state the gateway needs to build response headers.

### 3.2 Configure a limit

Limits are set out of band and refreshed by the limiter on an interval, never read from this call on the hot path.

Key idea. The limiter answers a question and always returns 200; the gateway owns the client connection and turns a deny into a 429 with Retry-After.

## 4. Data model

The data model begins with the simplest counter the problem needs; the window algorithm and the lifetime requirement each reshape it.

### 4.1 The counter, shaped by algorithm

The base state is key → count. The window algorithm decides the exact shape: a fixed window keys by (key, window_start); a sliding window counter holds the current and previous counts; a sliding window log holds a sorted set of timestamps; a token bucket holds the token balance and the last refill time.

### 4.2 Lifetime and placement

Every entry carries a TTL equal to its window, so idle keys evict themselves (SET key value EX window_seconds) and memory stays bounded by active keys, not all keys ever seen. The state lives in a single shared in-memory store, accessed only by exact-match key — there are no range queries, which is what lets the store shard cleanly by key hash.

Key idea. The counter's shape follows the algorithm, and a per-window TTL bounds memory to active keys without any cleanup job.

## 5. High-level design

The design is easiest to follow when built from the smallest version that could work, letting each failure pull in the next box.

Reading the diagrams. Each step marks the components newly added at that step with a dashed outline and a NEW badge, so you can see what changed from the step before.

### 5.1 A counter in the app server

The simplest limiter is an in-process counter per key: increment on each request, reset every window, deny past the limit. On one server it is correct.

This single-server design fails as soon as a load balancer puts two servers behind it. Each server sees half the traffic and counts only its own half. With a 100-per-second limit and two servers, each sees 100 per second, each thinks it is exactly at the limit, and together they let 200 through. The limit is broken.

### 5.2 Fix 1: move the counter to a shared store

The count has to live somewhere both servers see. It moves to a counter store: the limiter becomes a stateless service that reads and writes that store, and every app server calls it through a thin limiter client.

Now both servers share one count. But a new failure appears: two limiter instances can read the same value before either writes it back.

### 5.3 Fix 2: make the read-modify-write atomic

Two instances both read 99, both decide "under 100," both write 100, and both allow — a classic race. The fix is to make read, decide, and write one indivisible operation. An in-memory store that processes commands one at a time provides exactly this: while one request's increment runs, no other can slip between its read and its write, so a bare INCR needs no locking. Multi-step logic runs as a small server-side script that executes start to finish with nothing interleaved.

The script increments, sets the TTL on first touch, and returns the new count in one shot. The race is gone — but the store is now a single point of failure on the path of every request.

### 5.4 Fix 3: remove the single point of failure

If the counter store dies, every limiter decision dies with it, and so does every service behind it. A replica with automatic failover makes a primary loss a seconds-long blip rather than an outage. Two more boxes belong off the hot path: a config store the limiter refreshes every 30 seconds (never read per request), and a telemetry pipeline that receives per-decision events asynchronously (never blocking a decision).

### 5.5 The composed design and its latency budget

The pieces compose into one path: client → gateway → limiter client → limiter service → an atomic op against a sharded, replicated counter store, with config and telemetry alongside.

The whole decision is one in-datacenter round-trip — roughly half a millisecond — plus the script's own microseconds. That is the latency floor the constraint demanded, and the reason the next decisions focus on minimizing or bounding that round-trip.

Key idea. Each component answers one failure of the naive design: a shared store for many servers, an atomic script for the race, a replica for the single point of failure, and config and telemetry kept off the hot path.

## 6. Deep dives

Four decisions shape the limiter: which window algorithm to count with, whether to keep the counter central or go hybrid, how to behave when things fail, and how to observe what the limiter is doing.

### 6.1 Choosing the window algorithm

Before reading on. A client sends 100 requests at 00:00:59 and 100 more at 00:01:01, under a limit of 100 per minute. No single fixed window is violated. Why is that a problem, and which algorithm catches it?

A fixed window counts only the current bucket, so those two bursts sit in different buckets and both pass — 200 requests in two seconds, double the intended rate, the boundary burst. A sliding window counter weights the previous bucket's count by how much of the current window has not yet elapsed, then adds the current bucket. Just 3% into the new window (elapsed = 0.03), the previous 100 still counts almost fully: 100 × (1 − 0.03) + 100 ≈ 197, above the limit of 100, so the request is denied — catching the boundary burst the fixed window let through.

The animated widget in Key concepts shows this directly: under the same burst, the fixed window allows it while the sliding counter denies it.

The sliding window counter is the right default for API limits: O(1) memory and a measured error around 0.003% across hundreds of millions of requests (Cloudflare). The sliding window log fits only when the count must be exact — billing-critical limits — at the cost of a timestamp per request. The token bucket fits when bursts are a feature, not a bug: it lets a client spend a saved-up balance (say, up to 50 at once) and then enforces the average refill rate. Leaky bucket is its mirror — the same single-counter cost, but it smooths output into a steady stream instead of allowing bursts, so it 

A key usually carries more than one limit at once — say 100/sec and 10,000/day — and a single request must honor both. The check increments both counters inside one atomic script and denies if either window is over its max; the request passes only when both do. The response reports the binding window — the one nearest its limit — so remaining is the smaller of the two, and on a denial retry_after_seconds comes from the soonest reset among the violated windows: if only the per-second window is over, the client waits about a second, not until midnight. Putting both increments in the same script 

### 6.2 Central versus hybrid counting

Before reading on. A central counter is exact but costs one round-trip per decision. How do you get a microsecond decision without giving up on a limit that is roughly right?

A central counter is the simplest correct design: one authoritative store, every decision an atomic op against it. Its floor is one round-trip — about half a millisecond in-datacenter — which is fine until that floor is too high or the shard is too hot. The hybrid pattern keeps a local counter per key on each instance and syncs a delta with the center on a short interval, reading back the global state. Decisions become local and microsecond-fast; the cost is bounded over-allowance during each sync gap.

The over-allowance scales with fleet size × per-instance rate × sync interval, the number the estimation widget computes. A token-leasing variant tightens it further: the central store hands each instance a lease — say 1/N of the limit — which the instance burns locally and refills when depleted.

For example, the limit is 1,000 requests/sec across 4 instances. Each leases 250 tokens from the central store up front and then decides locally, with no network on the hot path. Instance A catches a burst and burns its 250 in 40ms, so it asks the center for 250 more. The center keeps one piece of state — how many of the 1,000 are currently leased out — and grants the refill only if the global budget still has room; if all 1,000 are already leased, A is denied until a lease frees up. The bound is different from periodic sync because an instance can over-spend at most its own outstanding lease 

The spectrum runs from central-exact through local-cache, periodic-sync, and token-leasing to sketch-based estimates; the design states where it sits on this spectrum and why.

### 6.3 Failure: atomicity, fail-open, and the retry storm

Before reading on. The counter store fails over for three seconds. During those three seconds, should the limiter allow everything or deny everything — and how do you keep a denied client from making the outage worse?

Three failure modes stack here, and each has its own fix.

The first is the race, already met in the HLD: do the read-modify-write as one atomic script (INCR then EXPIRE together), never as two separate commands with a check in between. The second is the store outage. A primary loss takes the limiter — and every service behind it — down unless a replica fails over automatically, and even then there is a seconds-long window where decisions cannot reach fresh state. That window forces the fail-open versus fail-closed choice. Failing open by default suits ordinary throttling — a limiter outage should not take the API down with it. Failing closed is reser

Fail-open is safer with a backstop. Two tiers provide it: a coarse in-process token bucket at the gateway — per IP, at perhaps 10× the normal rate — that keeps working during a counter-store outage because it needs no network, and the real per-key distributed limiter behind it. A deny from either tier stops at the gateway as a 429; an error from the distributed tier falls through to the in-process tier, which stops only the worst abuse without taking the API down.

The third mode is the retry storm. Denying a busy client that retries immediately replaces one over-limit request with two. A Retry-After with a sensible base plus small random jitter prevents this; a single fixed delay re-synchronizes every client into the next spike. Clients that ignore Retry-After are a known failure mode; the gateway should track repeat offenders and apply harder backoff.

A fourth pressure is the hot key — one popular key whose traffic saturates a single shard, independent of any client misbehavior. The load is spread with virtual sub-counters. For example, key X takes 100,000 requests/sec against a 10,000/sec limit, far more than one shard can serve. Split the key into 10 sub-counters X#0 … X#9, each on a different shard with a 1,000/sec slice of the limit. Each request hashes to one sub-counter (hash(request) % 10) and is allowed or denied by that sub-counter alone. Ten shards now share the 100K/sec firehose at 10K/sec each, and the slices sum to the original

### 6.4 Observability and safe rollout

Before reading on. A 429 spike just paged you. Is it correct enforcement of a real abuser, or a limit someone misconfigured? What would you need to have been recording to tell the difference in seconds?

Limiter decisions are silent unless something breaks, which makes three things worth recording: per-key allow-versus-deny counts (to tell a real abuser from a bad config), counter-store health (per-shard latency, error rate, replication lag), and every configuration change (each one is a deploy-equivalent event — old value, new value, who, when). The non-negotiable pattern is to emit these asynchronously and aggregate at one-second resolution before shipping, so observability never sits on the hot path.

New limits roll out in shadow mode: the system logs what would be denied without denying anything for a day or two, then enforcement is enabled once the numbers look right. This catches the misconfiguration that would otherwise become an incident the moment the limit goes live.

Key idea. Emit decisions asynchronously and aggregate before shipping, and shadow-test every new limit before it can reject real traffic.

## 7. Variants

For 10× scale (around 10M decisions per second), the architecture holds but the breakpoints move. Sharding by key with consistent hashing — which maps keys to shards while moving only a small fraction of keys when shards are added or removed — crosses 100+ shards, and the central round-trip dominates enough that hybrid with token leasing becomes mandatory: 100 instances, a lease of ~1% of the limit refreshed about every second, in-process decisions near 10 microseconds, over-allowance bounded to one lease per instance. Hot-key mitigation stops being optional, per-decision logging is replaced b

For one global limit across regions, accept that synchronous global counting is off the table — a cross-region round-trip is 50–100ms, fatal on a hot path. Split the global limit per region and reconcile asynchronously, or, for daily and monthly limits, use borrow-and-settle. For a daily limit, the global budget is 1,000,000 requests/day. At the start of the day each region borrows a slice from a global ledger — us-east takes 500K, eu-west 300K, ap-south 200K — and from then on each region enforces only its own slice locally, with no cross-region call on the hot path. After the window closes, 

For billing-critical limits, where overage costs money, three things change together: the algorithm becomes the sliding window log for exactness, the counter goes central-exact and never hybrid (a few extra milliseconds per call is an acceptable price for being right), and the failure mode flips to fail-closed. Dedupe on the idempotency key before the rate-limit check, so a client's retry does not consume quota twice.

Key idea. The same limiter scales by changing one axis at a time — coordination for raw throughput, regional strategy for global limits, algorithm and failure mode for billing accuracy.

## 8. The transferable pattern

A rate limiter is a counter primitive plus a coordination strategy, and almost every hard decision is choosing one of those two independently. Change the coordination — central, hybrid, regional, borrow-and-settle — and the limiter scales across orders of magnitude. Change the algorithm — fixed, sliding counter, sliding log, token bucket — and it trades memory for accuracy. Change the input — per-key, per-endpoint, per-cost-weight — and it bills differently.

That decomposition is what transfers. Most distributed-counter problems — analytics, trending, deduplication, leader election — reduce to the same shape: a shared count that many nodes must agree on, where coordination cost is traded against accuracy. Once the shape is recognized, the design follows from how much coordination is affordable.

## Review: the 30-second answer

The design rests on five decisions, each derived above:

Stateless limiter over a shared counter store. One atomic op per decision, one in-datacenter round-trip.

Sliding window counter by default. Log for billing accuracy, token bucket when bursts are a feature.

Atomic read-modify-write. INCR and EXPIRE in one script — never a separate check-then-set.

Fail-open with an in-process backstop. Fail-closed only for billing-critical limits.

Hybrid at scale. Local counters with periodic sync or token leases — bounded over-allowance for microsecond decisions.
